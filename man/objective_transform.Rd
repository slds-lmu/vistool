\usage{
objective_transform(value, d1, d2, id = "custom", domain = NULL)

objective_transform_identity()

objective_transform_log(eps = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{(\verb{function(v)}) Scalar transformation applied to the base
objective value.}

\item{d1}{(\verb{function(v)}) First derivative of the transformation with respect
to \code{v}.}

\item{d2}{(\verb{function(v)}) Second derivative of the transformation with respect
to \code{v}.}

\item{id}{(\code{character(1)}) Identifier used for logging and labels.}

\item{domain}{(\verb{function(v)}) Optional guard that should throw an informative
error if the transform is undefined for \code{v}. Called before evaluating the
transformation or its derivatives.}

\item{eps}{(\code{numeric(1)}) Non-negative smoothing constant added before taking
the logarithm. Use a positive value to guard against zero crossings.}
}
\value{
A list describing the transform. The list carries class
\code{"objective_transform"} and contains the entries \code{value}, \code{d1}, \code{d2}, \code{id},
and \code{domain}.
}
\description{
Construct reusable scalar transformations for objective functions. A transform
is described by its value function and first and second derivatives with
respect to the scalar objective value. The returned object can be supplied to
\code{\link{Objective}} instances to obtain transformed values, gradients, and Hessians
without re-deriving model specific logic.
}
\examples{
identity_transform = objective_transform_identity()
log_transform = objective_transform_log()

identity_transform$value(10)
log_transform$d1(10)
