    # - Everything else (functions, variables, arguments, files) MUST be snake_case.
    # Limitation: lintr's object_name_linter cannot distinguish "class objects" from other objects,
    # so we allow both styles globally and rely on code review for enforcement where needed.
    # If you see a non-class object named in CamelCase, please rename it to snake_case.
